# cirq-qrack

This repository contains a Qrack plugin for Cirq. You must [install Qrack](https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack) to use it.

The underlying Qrack simulator is a high-performance, GPU-accelarated, noiseless simulator, by design. This repository provides the Qrack QasmSimulator simulator.

This plugin is based on and adapted from work by the qulacs team, the IBM Qiskit Team, and QCGPU's creator, Adam Kelly. Attribution is noted in content files, where appropriate. Original contributions and adaptations were made by Daniel Strano of the Qrack/VM6502Q Team.
